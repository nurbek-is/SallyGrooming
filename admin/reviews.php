                <p>Sandy's Grooming  is a GREAT company. The entire team is always so flexible and wonderful! We are definitely sad to be moving away from them! It was great knowing that our pet was in good hands while we were at work all day. They would frequently send us pictures and updates on what was going on, and we could feel a genuine love and interest in our Pet!”        –Emily W, client since 2014 </p>

                <div class='testimonial-para'><p>Sandy's Grooming  has been a great help to me during my travels. My Sphynx (hairless) cat Prunella is a bit more high maintenance then most cats, but Prune’s sitters have embraced her like their own! I was very nervous at first leaving Prune, (Sphynx are very people oriented and don’t do well being left alone for extended periods) but daily updates & photos put me at ease.  Returning home to a cheerful little cat lets me know that she is well cared for and loved while I am away! The team is always prompt in responding to emails and the website allows you to schedule and communicate with ease.  If they are this good with Prune, I have no problem recommending them for all pet sitting & walking needs!” –Beck H., client since 2014 </p></div>
