    <p>Kate has been with us since 2009, and she is one of our most admired pet groomers here who got the degree in grooming in China. Kate: "In Asia, dog-grooming is a form of art, groomers are held to a very high standard. I immediately developed an extreme interest in the Asian techniques, when I was first introduced to it, a few years ago. It quickly became my passion. I not only wanted to further my education in the grooming industry, but I wanted to bring the same techniques and meticulous grooming styles to the USA. Yin Li was one of the first academies to help me accomplish my goal. “As a young child, I have always had an interest in dogs. Once I became of legal age to get a job, a pet grooming salon, was one of my first choices. The day that I picked up my first pair of scissors everything just felt right, and the rest is history from there."</p>

    <p>Van is our long time loved stuff member since 2002, he is avid pet lover and shares his incredible passion for pets. Here is what he tells about the industry: "Pet grooming is an incredibly skilled profession. It carries many dangers not only for the groomer but also for the dog. Razor-sharp scissors and a wriggly puppy are not a marriage made in heaven. A skilled and experienced hand is essential to anyone paying for this service. Over the years I have lost count of the number of times people have commented on the cost of their dog’s haircut – “My hair doesn’t cost that much,” and the like.

    Well, there are many reasons why your dog’s haircut is more expensive than yours. You don’t try to bite your hairdresser, you don’t poo on the barber chair, or pee against the wall once your hair cut is finished. You keep your head still when asked. Your hairdresser doesn’t clip your private parts or shave your legs (at least not the ones I know). I could go on!"</p>
